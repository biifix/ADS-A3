Algorithm 1 (BFS without duplicate detection) could not solve this puzzle.
The puzzle is too complex for naive BFS - it runs out of memory or takes too long
due to the exponential state space explosion without duplicate state pruning.

Puzzle: test_puzzles/capability11
Status: Failed (killed due to excessive memory usage or timeout)

This is expected behavior for Algorithm 1 on complex puzzles.
Algorithm 2 (with radix tree) or Algorithm 3 (with novelty pruning)
should be able to solve this puzzle efficiently.
